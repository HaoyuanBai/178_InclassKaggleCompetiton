# 178KaggleCompetiton-Prediction of the Presence or Absence of Rainfall at a Particular Location      
The competition data are satellite-based measurements of cloud temperature (infrared imaging), being used to predict the presence or absence of rainfall at a particular location. The target value is a binary indicator of whether there was rain (measured by radar) at that location; and data are slightly imbalanced (positives make up about 30% of the training data).

The method that worked the best is random forest, and it out performed everything else by a good margin. We believe that random forest classification performs well on most of the cases, and not specifically to this case. It is generally a strong algorithm because it can train the model a lot with many iterations and avoid overfitting at the same time by introducing randomness by selecting random features to use. The worst method was a linear model by far. It might be our fault in that we did not thoroughly try to find the best features, but we think that itâ€™s also because the pattern is complex. We tried polynomial transformed features for linear models, which is 119 features, but it still did not perform well. For a linear model, we have to define features, which is like defining patterns that the linear model can support. For other models, they can detect very complex patterns by themselves without having us specify the pattern.
