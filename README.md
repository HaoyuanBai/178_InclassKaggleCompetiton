# 178KaggleCompetiton-Prediction of the Presence or Absence of Rainfall at a Particular Location      
The competition data are satellite-based measurements of cloud temperature (infrared imaging), being used to predict the presence or absence of rainfall at a particular location. The target value is a binary indicator of whether there was rain (measured by radar) at that location; and data are slightly imbalanced (positives make up about 30% of the training data).

The method that worked the best is random forest and  worst method was a linear model by far. It might be our fault in that did not thoroughly try to find the best features, but it also might be because the pattern is complex.
